				<h1>
					Using The CDM D2L Template
				</h1>

					You're ready to create a course that is easy to teach with and easy to learn with.

					What Now?
				</h2>
				<h4 class="subheader">You've installed the template and you're ready to work, but where should you start?</h4>
				<p>The following steps will get you familiarized with the Desire2Learn environment, walk you through the included course materials, and give you two options for how to begin working.</p>
				<div class="panel">
					<h4 class="subheader">
						1 - Familiarize yourself with the Instructor Files <small><strong>This will take:</strong> 30 minutes to 2 hours</small>
					</h4>
					<p>Click the links in the left navigation area. Doing so will familiarize yourself with the navigation of D2L. When reading the D2L Overview, click on the sections as you read about them and come back to this page. Explore a bit, and get familiar. Make notes about what tools could be useful in your course.</p>
				</div>


				<div class="panel">
					<h4 class="subheader">
						2 - Familiarize yourself with the Example and Getting Started Module <small><strong>This will take:</strong> 30 minutes to 1 hour</small>
					</h4>
					<p><strong>Look over the Example Module.</strong> Think about how you'd fill out the existing Modules (folders) and Topics (files) and how your current course structure would fit into the existing structure, or how you would change the Modules and Topics to suit your course. Making more notes about course structure and what you want your students to get out of the course is a great idea here.</p>
					<p><strong>Look over the Getting Started Module.</strong> What is the course about? How should the students get in touch with you? Do they need software, books, or materials? Your syllabus covers most of this, but making it easily discoverable by students means they'll look before asking you.</p>

						3 - Now, you have a choice:
					</h3>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="large-6 columns">
								<h4 class="subheader">
									Start working independently
								</h4>
								<hr />
								<p>Everything makes sense, you're comfortable in D2L and will only need a few pointers getting your course going.</p>
								<p>Start working and touch base for guidance or if you have any questions!</p>

						</div>
						<div class="large-6 columns">
								<h4 class="subheader">
									Talk to Us
								</h4>
								<hr />
								<p>Everything mostly makes sense, you're okay in D2L but want to know what to do now.</p>
								<p>Send an email to Ian at ihall@depaul.edu and we'll meet to plan your next steps!</p>

					The Teaching Commons <a href="http://teachingcommons.depaul.edu/Technology/D2L/index.html">Desire2Learn documentation</a> is an excellent resource.
