          <p>Learning objectives articulate the knowledge and skills you want students to acquire by the end of the module or course in measurable terms. The measurable terms should be related to the assessment strategy, for example:</p>
<ul><li>being able to "identify the new HTML 5 tags" would be assessed by providing students a list and asking them to "identify" the correct items,</li><li>which is different from "describe the new HTML 5 tags" which would involve writing to "describe."</li></ul>
